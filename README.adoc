= beeLÄ«n Java / JVM

This is the start of a DNSChain client for the JVM. The client is currently written in Groovy, but will likely be converted to Java.

== Install Prerequisites

Make sure you have JDK 7 or later installed.

== Build and run tests

    ./gradlew build

You can view the test results in `beelinj-lib/build/reports/tests/index.html`

Of course you probably want to install https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA] to do this.
